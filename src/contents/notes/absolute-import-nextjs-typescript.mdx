description: Configure absolute import for Next JS Typescript Project 
---

Every time we create a new Next JS Project, by default it uses relative import. 

```tsx
import { getSlugs } from "../../lib/helpers/getSlugs";
```

At first, it looks simple. But as our project can be more complex and bigger, it can be difficult to maintain and use. Absolute import can simplified that.

Before using absolute import, we must configure our `tsconfig.json` file. In `tsconfig.json`, more spesific in `compilerOptions`, we can add the configuration like this:

```json /"baseUrl"/#v
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src"
  }
}
```

I use [src folder](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory). So, the folder like `pages`, `styles` which was originally in root directory, i can move it to `src` folder.

We also can configure path aliases, like this: 

```json /"paths"/#v
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": ["*"],
    }
  }
}
```

Because i've already set `baseUrl` to `src`, then i dont need to import components like this `src/components/*`.

For the `paths`, you can adjust it with your project structure.

So, for importing file, we can do that like this: 

```tsx /~lib/#v
import { getSlugs } from "~/lib/helpers/getSlugs";
```
