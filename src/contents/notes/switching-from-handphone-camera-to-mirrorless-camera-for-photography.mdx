description: Try to switch from Handphone Camera to Mirrorless Camera for Photography
---

Recently, i bought a camera for taking photos and videos. The camera is Sony A5000. At first, there were several camera options i considered, like **Fujifilm XA3**, **Fujifilm XM1**, **and Sony A5000**. After careful consideration and watching many review videos, I finally choose the Sony A5000.

The camera i purchased was a second-hand, but thankfully it's in almost new condition, because after i do an inspection to the camera, there are no dents or scratches on the camera body. I also checked the Shutter Count (SC), and it was around 6000++ (I forgot the exact number). For a camera that's around 9 years old, this is considered low, meaning the previous owner rarely used it.

## Why you bought a real camera if you can just take photos with your phone?

Yes, that's right. I could still use my phone for casual photography, but the issue lies with the built-in camera on my phone, which isn't very good. So, i'm using Gcam(Google Camera) with custom configurations to get better and more detailed results. The front-facing camera is unreliable in low-light conditions, especially during meetings and zoom calls.

Enough talk, let's take some photos! Here are some photos i captured with the Sony A5000 + Kit Lens 16-50mm. **Note: the last photo has been edited with Snapseed, while the others have not been edited at all.**
